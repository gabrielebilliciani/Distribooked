## Distribooked: A Distributed Library Management System

This project was developed as part of the *Large-Scale and Multi-Structured Databases course*, with the aim of exploring scalable database solutions and efficient data management techniques in a real-world scenario.

## Application Overview

Imagine a world where you have free access to books, as simple as a few clicks on your device. Our application, *Distribooked*, reimagines how users interact with libraries, bringing a seamless, user-friendly experience to both avid readers and library administrators.

As a reader, you can easily explore a vast collection of books, searching by title, author, or category. Want to find the most popular reads in your favourite genres? The system highlights the most popular books in various categories. Once you've found the perfect book, our system helps you locate the nearest libraries where it's available. If it's a must-read, you can reserve it right away and pick it up at your convenience.

But it doesn't stop there. The system keeps track of your reading history, helps you manage reservations, and provides an easy way to check the status of your loans. For those who love planning their next read, you can save books to your favourites and keep track of what you've borrowed.

For library administrators, our application simplifies everyday operations. They can manage inventory, track overdue returns, and get insights into reading trends, helping them make informed decisions to serve their communities better.

*Distribooked* is more than a tool; it's a bridge connecting readers and libraries, fostering a culture of learning and exploration in a way that's accessible and engaging for everyone.
